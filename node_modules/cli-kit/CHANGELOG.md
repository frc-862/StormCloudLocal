# v1.16.0 (Apr 21, 2022)

 * feat: Add support for extension CLIs with multiple exported entrypoints that do not use cli-kit.
   Fixes [#97](https://github.com/cb1kenobi/cli-kit/issues/97).
 * chore: Updated dependencies.

# v1.15.0 (Apr 10, 2022)

# v1.14.0 (Jul 27, 2021)

 * feat: Added `redact` flag to arguments and options so advanced implementations can know if an
   argument/option may contain sensitive information. Redact flag is `true` by default, but can
   be set to false in the paramters or prefixing the name with a `~` such as `"<~myoption>"`.
   Note that option flags (those without a value) default to `false` since the value is boolean.

   help content.

 * chore: Updated dependencies.

# v1.8.4 (Nov 10, 2020)

   values or alter the context tree.
 * feat(command): Added `callback` parameter that is fired as soon as the parser finds the command.
 * refactor(parser): `Parser` now extends a `HookEmitter` and is linked to the `CLI` instance to
   decouple the `CLI` from the `Parser`.
 * refactor(parser): Moved default value initialization and populating `argv` and `_` to end of
   parser chain so that option callbacks have the ability to modify the contexts and continue
   parsing.

   v1.3.0 when generated JSON object is stringified.

 * fix(help): Allow non-Error objects to be thrown and rendered on the help screen.

 * fix(cli): Fixed rendering of errors to debug log when server connection executes a command that
   throws an exception.

# v1.3.0 (Jul 21, 2020)

 * feat(cli): Added `exec` hook event.
 * feat(context): Added `ctx` property to `generateHelp` hook event.
 * fix(parser): Fixed bug in server mode where `parse` hook event was being omitted from the cloned
   context which is not accessible instead of the originating `CLI` instance.
 * fix(cli): Fixed issue with server mode execution where a context would be deeply cloned, however
   `Command` and `Extension` objects were passed by reference.
 * chore: Updated dependencies.

# v1.2.4 (Jun 24, 2020)

 * fix(cli): Server-side output streams extend TTY `WriteStream` to improve compatibility with
   packages that check `isTTY` and terminal helper functions such as `cursorTo()` and
   `clearLine()`.

 * feat(cli): Added `timeout` option to `CLI.connect()` with default of 5 seconds.
 * fix(cli): `CLI.connect()` now waits for terminal resize handshake to complete before resolving.

 * fix(parser): Fixed regression introduced in 24f5048 where parser context chains where processed
   one context at a time instead of chaining them all together.
